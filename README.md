# Iris Dataset Model

This project focuses on analyzing the Iris dataset and building a machine learning model to classify flower species based on their features. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset widely used for machine learning and data analysis projects.

## Features

- **Dataset:** The Iris dataset contains features such as `SepalLength`, `SepalWidth`, `PetalLength`, and `PetalWidth` for classification.
- **Data Analysis:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the dataset and visualize patterns.
- **Model:** Implements a machine learning classifier to predict flower species.
- **Evaluation:** Uses metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to evaluate the model's performance.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to install the following libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and load the Iris dataset.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess data, build the model, and visualize results.

## File Structure

- **IRIS_model.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete workflow.
- **iris.csv**: Dataset file (not included; download the Iris dataset if required).

## How to Run

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

2. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook IRIS_model.ipynb
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to analyze data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
